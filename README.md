# Inventory-Management-System

This project is created as a part of my Summer Internship(Aug-Sep 2021).   
It is based on designing an Inventory Management System where we can perform tasks like displaying all the existing products in the inventory, adding new products, increasing the quantity of products in the inventory and keeping a tally of all the products purchased and the time they have been purchased at.
Loops have been used to add or purchase multiple products at the same time.

The data of each product (product ID, name, price and quantity) gets stored in the "record.json" file.  
The data of all the purchased goods (sl. no., product ID, quantity and the time of the purchase) gets stored in the "sales.json" file.

## Libraries Used:
- time 
- json
